# Student Loan Bill Tracker
Contribute short write-ups about student loan legislation in your state or Congress.

## Contribution Guidelines
*Bills should only be included if they address the student loan problem directly (riders, such as we saw with the ACA, are okay). General omnibus education bills may increase higher ed funding a smidge and thus arguably decrease borrowing for future students, but such bills are passed regularly and should not be listed here, whereas a "free tuition for all" bill is a game changer that would clearly decrease or eliminate borrowing and should be listed here.
*State bills should go in individual `State.md` files, Federal bills should go in USCongress.md.
